# Compare Estimators

This project compares the performance of post-Lasso (BCCH, 2012) and RJIVE (Hansen and Kozbur 2014) with REL and BC-REL
in a linear IV model.

* The estimation of REL and BC-REL has been done.
* We need to code up post-Lasso and RJIVE


### Functionality

* `master_IV.m` is the master file for the Monte Carlo simulation.
* `dgpLinearIV.m` generates the data `y`, `x` and `z` in each simulation.
